### Hey there 👋

Hi, my full name is Javad PourMostafa (pronounced /'dʒævɒd puːr'moʊs'tae'fɑː/)! I go by joeybright or joyebright wherever I can get the username.

I am currently a first-year PhD candidate at the Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence{:target="new"} of Tilburg University{:target="new"}. My PhD thesis, entitled "An NMT Framework based on Language Understanding". It is divided into two main parts: i) will investigate neural machine translation for low-resource language, e.g. Persian, through cross-lingual knowledge transfer, and (ii) aims to delve into multilingual and multi-domain adaptation.

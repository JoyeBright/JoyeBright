My full name is Javad Pourmostafa (pronounced /'dʒævɒd puːr'moʊs'tae'fɑː/)! I go by joeybright or joyebright wherever I can get the username. I am currently a first-year PhD candidate at the Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAI) of Tilburg University. I am also affiliated with the machine translation group at the Tilburg University: MT++. My PhD thesis, entitled "An NMT Framework based on Language Understanding". It is divided into two main parts: i) will investigate neural machine translation for low-resource language, e.g. Persian, through cross-lingual knowledge transfer, and (ii) aims to delve into multilingual and multi-domain adaptation. More information can be found on my personal webpage at https://ilk.uvt.nl/~pourmost/.

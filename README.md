### Hey there 👋

My full name is Javad PourMostafa (pronounced /'dʒævɒd puːr'moʊs'tae'fɑː/)! I go by joeybright or joyebright wherever I can get the username. I am currently a first-year PhD candidate at the Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAI) of Tilburg University. My PhD thesis, entitled "An NMT Framework based on Language Understanding". It is divided into two main parts: i) will investigate neural machine translation for low-resource language, e.g. Persian, through cross-lingual knowledge transfer, and (ii) aims to delve into multilingual and multi-domain adaptation. More information can be found on my personal webpage at https://ilk.uvt.nl/~pourmost/.

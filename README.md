### Hey there 👋

My full name is Javad PourMostafa (pronounced /'dʒævɒd puːr'moʊs'tae'fɑː/)! I go by joeybright or joyebright wherever I can get the username. I am currently a postgraduate member at [Guilan NLP Group](https://nlp.guilan.ac.ir) and a part-time lecturer at the Computer Engineering Department of the [University of Guilan](https://guilan.ac.ir/en/home). I graduated with an MS degree in Software Engineering from the same university in 2019. During the master thesis, I worked on designing sentiment analysis models using deep learning architectures for low-resources corpora (case-study: Persian). My research mainly centralizes on natural language processing and deep learning. I'm also interested in AI more broadly; as to non-academic affairs, I spend my time on Unix-like servers maintenance.

### Hi there 👋

My full name is Javad PourMostafa and it is pronounced /'dʒævɒd puːr'moʊs'tae'fɑː/. I am currently a graduate member at [Guilan NLP Group](https://nlp.guilan.ac.ir) and a part-time lecturer at the Computer Engineering Department of the [University of Guilan](https://guilan.ac.ir/en/home). I graduated with an MS degree in Software Engineering from the same university in 2019. During the master thesis, I worked on designing sentiment analysis models using deep learning architectures for low-resources corpora. My research interests mainly centralize on Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. However, as non-academic affairs, I spend my time on Unix-like servers maintenance.
